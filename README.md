This mini project was designed to help me get the hang of user accounts,
particularly password digestion. Users with an account can view posts as well
as the author of said posts, whilst users without an account can view only the posts
with no indication as to who the author is.

Css and styling was not taken into consideration at all -  I was more concerned with
the functionality of creating a platform in which users can log in securely
and have the app function differently as a result.
